In this repository you'll find my project for Openclassrooms. It's the fourth project of the Web developper course. There are the HTML files and the main css file, then you'll find a folder with Javascript, another one with CSS, one with pictures. These are the main folder, the other ones are useful too, download the whole code.
I use VSCode to code the website.
The main page is index.html, the other one is a contact page.
